# Multivariate Analysis of Facial Temperature Data

This repository contains coursework completed as part of my MSc, focusing on analyzing facial temperature measurements and predicting oral temperature using multivariate statistical techniques.

## Overview
The dataset contains infrared facial temperature measurements from human subjects, along with oral temperature and demographic information. The objective is to explore patterns in facial temperature, classify subjects, and predict oral temperature using multivariate analysis techniques.

## Objectives
Key objectives of the analysis include:

- Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of facial and oral temperature measurements  
- Detection and removal of measurement errors and outliers  
- Identification of clusters in facial temperature profiles using hierarchical and k-means clustering  
- Classification of subjects by gender using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Derivation and visualization of principal component scores  
- Prediction of oral temperature using Principal Components Regression (PCR)  

## Methods Applied
- Data preprocessing and outlier removal  
- Hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering for profile analysis  
- LDA and QDA for classification tasks  
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  
- Principal Components Regression (PCR) for predicting correlated outcomes  

## Key Analytical Components
- Clustering structure identification and comparison of methods  
- Model-based classification of subjects using discriminant analysis  
- Examination of variance explained by principal components  
- Prediction of oral temperature while addressing multicollinearity  
- Discussion of method choices and rationale
